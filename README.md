            Let's start
            
            First step: 
            First step is to set up a Parse Server on AWS : To store users photos we need to set up a server 
                                                             so that we can share or view photos.For this we
                                                             use Parse Server. Parse Server is the open source
                                                             backened.It allows you to have database without 
                                                             managing  all code yourself.Parse server is completely
                                                             stored in our own server.For using Parse server we make
                                                             use of AWS(Amazon web service).
                                                             
           Second step:
           
            In second step we are going to learn Advanced Parse Technique: In this step we are learning about the methods to 
            store data in Parse server and to get data from parse server.
            
            Third step: 
            
            Advanced Queries: In this step we learn about finding data from parse server using parse queries and update that data.
            
            Fourth Step:
            
            In this step we built Login and SignUp page and learn Advance Keyboard Features.
            
            Fifth Step:
            
            After LogIn Page we see list of users.

            LastStep:
            
            In this step we learn about getting user's feed .
            
            Yiepiee, Now we are able to build  basic Instagram App .

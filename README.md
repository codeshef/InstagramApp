            Let's start
            
            First step: 
            First step is to set up a Parse Server on AWS : To store users photos we need to set up a server 
                                                             so that we can share or view photos.For this we
                                                             use Parse Server. Parse Server is the open source
                                                             backened.It allows you to have database without 
                                                             managing  all code yourself.Parse server is completely
                                                             stored in our own server.For using Parse server we make
                                                             use of AWS(Amazon web service).
                                                             
           Second step:
            In second step we are going to learn Advanced Parse Technique:
